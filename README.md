Robot Code
The robot code is for a version of an autonomous vehicle which can drive on an elevated path without falling off. It uses servos
as well as ultrasonic sensors to accomplish this task.

Led Grid Control
The led code is used in conjunction with 4 push buttons to control a 12 x 10 led grid. One led is on and can be moved on the grid
using the push buttons.
